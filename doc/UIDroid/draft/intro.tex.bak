The exponential growth of mobile devices has raised security concerns.
In this paper, we focus on detecting privacy leaking transmissions from authentic apps in popular Android markets.
Compared to malware, authentic apps still perform their proposed functionality.
However, they may also put users at risk by behaving in a user-unexpected way, such as stealthily sending user’s private information out for purposes such as analytics, advertising, cross-application profiling, and social computing [31].
Static and dynamic program taint analysis of apps focus on identifying whether sensitive data leaves the user device.
They treat all sensitive transmission as illegal, so that suffer from high false positive rate.
To address this critical problem, we take into account user intention and define illegal flows as follows: a transmission flow is illegitimate if given the app-level
context, the user considers the transmission is not required
for its functionalities.
